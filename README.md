# Raytracer

## Description 

This project, developed in C++, is an advanced Raytracer application that utilizes OpenMP for parallel computing to enhance performance. The project features motion blur, global illumination, and depth of field, designed to encapsulate and illustrate the intricate processes of rendering photorealistic images from 3D models and scenes, effectively demonstrating the power and capabilities of computer graphics programming.

## OpenMP Parallelization

This project incorporates OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing), a parallel programming model for shared-memory multiprocessor architectures, to achieve faster performance. By distributing computations across multiple CPU cores, the application can render complex scenes more quickly and efficiently.

## Important Note on Academic Integrity

While this repository is open to the public for learning and inspiration, it is expected that anyone viewing or using this code will respect the rules of academic integrity. This code should not be copied for use in academic or professional projects without proper understanding and attribution. Please use this repository as a reference and inspiration, not a source for plagiarism.

## Features

### Motion Blur

A feature that adds cinematic qualities to the rendered scenes, the motion blur function simulates the photographic phenomenon where fast-moving objects appear blurred along the direction of relative motion.

### Global Illumination 

By emulating how light interplays with objects within a scene, the global illumination feature provides richer and more lifelike visual outputs. It models the details of how light bounces around an environment and scatters in various directions, capturing the subtle nuances of natural light and shade.

### Depth of Field

This attribute allows for the simulation of the lens focus effect seen in real-world cameras. By adjusting the depth of field, users can emphasize specific subjects in the scene while artistically blurring other elements, creating a strikingly realistic and depth-perceptive visualization.
